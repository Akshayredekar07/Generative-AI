
### **Difference AI, ML, DL, and Generative AI**

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**  
  - Builds applications for tasks without human intervention.  
  - Example: General problem-solving systems.

- **ML (Machine Learning)**  
  - Subset of AI.  
  - Uses statistical tools for analysis, visualization, prediction, forecasting.  
  - Example: Netflix recommendation system.

- **DL (Deep Learning)**  
  - Subset of ML.  
  - Mimics human brain with multi-layered neural networks (ANN).  
  - Applications:  
    - Computer Vision: Object detection (CNN).  
    - Text: NLP (RNN).  
    - Time Series: Forecasting (RNN).  
  - Example: Self-driving cars.

- **Generative AI**  
  - Subset of DL.  
  - Creates new data (text, images).  
  - Techniques: Transformers, BERT.  
  - Models:  
    - Discriminative: Classifies data (classification, prediction).  
    - Generative: Generates data (LLM, HIM).  
    - Foundation Models: GPT-4, GPT-5 (Open AI), LLaMA (Meta), Gemini (Google), Claude-3 (Anthropic), Custom Dazzer.  
  - Process: Pre-trained on huge datasets, fine-tuned for specific use cases.  
  - Data Comparison: Person (100 books on cats) vs. GPTs (extensive pre-training).  
  - Example: Art generation, language models.
