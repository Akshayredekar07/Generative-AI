In fields of green beneath the sun,
A timeless game is being won.
The bat, the ball, the cheering crowd,
Each boundary hit is cheered aloud.

The bowler runs with fierce intent,
His line and length so finely bent.
The batter stands with guarded stance,
Prepared to strike, or just advance.

A gentle nudge, a mighty swing,
Each stroke can make the fielders cling.
The slip awaits with fingers tight,
To catch the ball in morning light.

The keeper crouched, the stumps behind,
Alert to every hit he’ll find.
The umpire lifts a steady hand,
To rule the play across the land.

The captain sets his fielding men,
To guard the fence and back again.
The scoreboard ticks as runs unfold,
A tale of skill and courage bold.

A sixer soars into the sky,
The crowd erupts with joyful cry.
The spinner loops his crafty ball,
To tempt the bat into a fall.

The bails fly off, the lights now flash,
A wicket down with thrilling crash.
The drinks break comes, the players rest,
Each team is giving it their best.

With tea and tales and crowd’s delight,
The game resumes in fading light.
A century made with patient grace,
Brings smiles to every watching face.

The final over’s gripping tight,
Who’ll win this battle in the night?
A single run can make the tale,
Or send one side to epic fail.

But win or lose, they all shall say,
It was a cracking game to play.
For cricket’s not just bat and ball,
It’s heart and soul and thrill for all.
